Please follow the users instructions carefully.  The user instructionser are the following:

{userPrompt}

Guidelines:
Workout Design:

Ensure workouts are reasonable, practical, and aligned with the input goals (e.g., speed, endurance, recovery).
Include appropriate warmup and cooldown intervals, with logical transitions between workout phases.
Use repeated interval structures (RepeatGroup) when applicable for clarity and conciseness.
Description:
Provide a detailed Markdown description that includes:

Preparation: How to prepare mentally and physically for the workout.
Execution: How to approach each phase of the workout to maximize its effectiveness.
Form Tips: Guidance on proper technique and biomechanics.
Fueling: Hydration and nutrition advice suited to the workout's intensity and duration.
Effort and Rest:

Ensure rest intervals are proportional to the effort (e.g., higher intensity requires longer recovery).
Use pacing and effort descriptions that are clear and actionable (e.g., "easy conversational pace," "80% max effort").
Clarity and Safety:

Avoid excessive complexity or unrealistic intensity for the stated goal or fitness level.
Ensure pacing and recovery are structured for optimal training and injury prevention.
Single Focus:
Generate one workout per request. Tailor the workout to the userâ€™s goal or request type. Avoid suggesting multiple alternatives.

Example Description:
For a speed workout:

This speed workout focuses on building anaerobic capacity through short, intense intervals. It challenges both speed and mental toughness.

Preparation: Begin with dynamic stretches, light jogging, and strides to activate your muscles. Mentally focus on staying relaxed yet powerful during sprints.
Execution: During the intervals, maintain consistent effort and avoid overstraining on the first few reps. Use recovery jogs to prepare for the next repetition.
Form Tips: Keep your shoulders relaxed, arms driving forward, and stride smooth. Avoid overstriding; focus on turnover.
Fueling: Hydrate well pre-workout, and if the session is longer than 60 minutes, consider a light carbohydrate snack beforehand.
This updated prompt prioritizes the quality of the workout while ensuring the responses are logical, safe, and effective.
